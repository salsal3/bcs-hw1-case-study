## Overview and Origin

* *Name of company*
You Need A Budget ([YNAB](https://www.youneedabudget.com/about-us/), "why-nab")
>
* *When was the company incorporated? Who are the founders of the company?*
YNAB was created on September 2004.
>
* *Who are the founders of the company?*
The company was founded by Jesse and Julie Mecham.
>
* *How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?*
After getting married, Jesse wanted to create a budget based off of [four rules](https://www.youneedabudget.com/the-four-rules/) that have become the foundation of the YNAB budgeting system:
  1. Give every dollar a job
  2. Embrace your true expenses
  3. Roll with the punches
  4. Age your money
>
* *How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?*
The company uses a software-as-a-service model, charging consumers on a monthly or annual basis. Jesse Mecham has also published a book for retail sale. [Owler](https://www.owler.com/company/youneedabudget?on=true) did not have a record of any other funding outside of these revenue streams.

## Business Activities:

* *What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?*
YNAB aims to help their customers gain control over their finances through a combination of education, technology, and a practical approach to budgeting.
>
* *Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?*
Their services are intended for the average consumer who wants to manage their own money, and who may be [living paycheck to paycheck](https://www.thebalance.com/ynab-vs-mint-5095744) or have a large amount of existing debt. It's less suitable for individuals who need to keep track of a large number of income sources and investments, and for business owners. According to [Allied Market Research](https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/personal-finance-software-market), the personal finance software market size was valued at \$1 million in 2019. This is projected to reach $1.5 million by 2027.
>
* *What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)*
YNAB's main draw is that they provide a unique approach to budgeting that is more about projecting and planning cash available on hand - a zero-based budgeting method at its core - rather than tracking expenses as they are made. As a testament to their desire of teaching financial literacy, they also publish several [free educational resources](https://www.youneedabudget.com/got-five-minutes/) that include workshops, blog articles, YouTube videos, and podcast episodes. These resources discuss topics such as saving for big expenses like weddings, managing finances with a partner, and budgeting for unexpected  situations.
>
* *Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them?*
YNAB's applications utilize a number of different [coding languages and software](https://stackshare.io/you-need-a-budget/you-need-a-budget), including JavaScript, HTML5, Ruby on Rails, Git, and GitHub. Team members use Slack to remotely communicate and collaborate with each other.
There are [several ways](https://www.youneedabudget.com/our-app-lineup/) for users to access their budget. On top of being accessible with any web browser, there are mobile applications for Android and iOS devices available to download. Budgets can also be accessed verbally through Alexa, and banking data can be imported through Plaid. YNAB even [provides their API](https://www.youneedabudget.com/introducing-ynabs-api/) so developers can create their own functions, many of which [the company collects](https://api.youneedabudget.com/#works-with-ynab-official) for other users to utilize.

## Landscape:

* *What domain of the financial industry is the company in?*
YNAB falls under the domain of personal finance.
>
* *What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?*
One major trend is the changing landscape of financial literacy. According to the recent results from a recurring study by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, only 34% of individuals who participated correctly answered 80% of the questions asked. Managing one's finances has become far more complex than the days when cash was king, as there are far more options and considerations than merely choose a banking institution. Individuals must choose what credit card offers them the best rewards, whether to apply for a traditional loan or go the route of social financing, or which type of investment option will net them the greatest return when it's time to retire.
<br> Fortunately, there are a number of free resources available that help consumers make informed decisions in managing their own finances. For example, MIT's OpenCourseWare YouTube channel has several lectures ranging from financial theory to technological trends in financial services, and even to blockchain technology. Several banking institutions and investment brokerages also seek to educate their clientele, such as JP Morgan and TD Ameritrade.
<br> With the trend in financial literacy in mind, consumers have more ways than ever to manage their finances from their mobile devices rather than on their home computer or on paper. This is made possible with the help of such innovations as mobile banking, chatbots and robo-advisors, online brokerages and automated investment portfolios, and budgeting applications like YNAB. It's become easier and more convenient for individuals to check their accounts, to project their expenses in both the short and the long term, and to create budget plans and investment decisions that meet their financial needs and goals no matter where they are geographically.
>
* *What are the other major companies in this domain?*
[Mint, NerdWallet,](https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/ynab) [PearBudget, and BudgetPulse](https://www.owler.com/company/youneedabudget?on=true) are among those that offer personal financing software and services similar to YNAB.

## Results

* *What has been the business impact of this company so far?*
According to the home page of their website, they've helped "hundreds of thousands of people get out of debt and gain control of their money," on average helping their customers "save \$600 in their first two months and more than \$6,000 their first year." 
>
* *What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?*
Some metrics include annual revenue, the size of their customer base, product and app reviews, and customer testimonials.
<br>YNAB has generated an estimated value of $8.6 million in revenue. The YNAB app currently has a rating of 4.3 stars through 7,400 votes on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.youneedabudget.evergreen.app&hl=en_US&gl=US), and a rating of 4.8 stars through 32,800 votes in the [iOS App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ynab-you-need-a-budget/id1010865877). [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/best-budgeting-apps/) rated YNAB the best platform for achieving financial goals when compared to 14 other budgeting apps, while [CNBC Select](https://www.cnbc.com/select/ynab-budgeting-app-review/) gave it a favorable review overall.
>
* *How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?*
YNAB has a loyal following and is straightforward with the services it offers. That sole focus on budgeting is also an aspect that has been cited as a con in some reviews. In The Balance's review comparing YNAB to Mint, the writer notes that YNAB's lack of credit score monitoring as a negative, given that Mint and similar free services are capable of this.

## Recommendations

* *If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)*
I would address two aspects of YNAB that are often cited in reviews, and those are the time needed to utilize the platform, and the cost of the service. Having personally used the platform, there *is* a considerable learning curve when first setting up a budget. While YNAB has no end of helpful guides and resources, it can still be overwhelming for someone who hasn't used a zero-based budget before.
<br>One possible reason this comes up so often is the interface of the mobile apps.The mobile apps are the main platforms used to access one's budgets, but the interface feels cluttered and lacks any customization. Some of this time transferring balances and transactions can be mitigated using Plaid to sign into banking and credit accounts, but there are always concerns of security and privacy when importing data in this way.
<br>My first suggestion would be to rework the UI for the mobile apps and allow for some degree of customization. As it is, the app looks like a basic list of user-defined categories and their associated items that can be collapsed or expanded. A way to reduce screen clutter and lessen the amount of scrolling could be by having the categories lead to a different page or tab where only items in that category are displayed. It would also be helpful if long-pressing a value or section of the budget pulled up a tooltip with a description of its function and tips on how to use it.
<br>Mint's mobile app also allows users to rearrange UI elements so they can customize what they're viewing in a given tab. One user can arrange their bills to show above their budget and cashflow on the main screen, while another can hide their bills altogether.
<br>YNAB also does not offer a free version of their app apart from a free trial, after which the user is locked out of their budget until they pay for a subscription. Several other budgeting apps, including Mint, are available for free. Considering many users are seeking ways to manage their existing debt, it can be difficult to justify paying the price of subscription over options that are free to use.
<br>The company could introduce a free version with limited functionality to their product line, as well as the ability to export a budget to a spreadsheet should the user discontinue their subscription. And while the free trial of 34 days is meant to give users time to learn the platform and to determine if the budget is working for them, providing a discount on the first paid month could entice those who may be on the fence to spend more time getting acquainted with its functions.
>
* *Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?*
The time needed to get started with creating and using the budget, and the cost of service are the two main concerns users have with YNAB. Improving on these key points would see a reduction in negative user experiences and the perception that the service is not worth the cost.
>
* *What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?*
While the changes to the UI and the pricing model may not require any additional technologies, it *would* require a shift in focus from available staff members.
>
* *Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?*
These improvements can be made with existing resources, which would minimize the cost of implementing such features.
